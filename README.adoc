.About Me
I am passionate about learning.
I enjoy learning, discovering, and discussing new and novel ideas and topics.
Growing up, my favorite subjects in school were mathematics, chemistry, and physics.
This passion extended to receiving a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Mathematics from Liberty University in 2020.
The desire for higher education is currently expressed in the pursuit of a PhD with Engineering from Liberty University with Dr. Mark Atwater.
To view a formal summary of my work and capabilities, please look at my link:Documents/Joby_M_Anthony_III.pdf[resume].

== Codes

:!tabs:

Much of the work I do is automated by scripts and codes for consistency and flexibility with respect to varying input parameters.
The Python packages were primarily written from _Numerical Methods_ and _Ordinary/Partial Differential Equations_ courses and are used extensively throughout much of other works.
The Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) repository is a by-product of taking an ICME course while access to the well-standing website (link:https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php.1.html[ICME-MS-CAVS]) has been denied for future users.
Much of the content in the ICME repository below references and collects information, processes, methodologies, and scripts from the original ICME website (link:https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php.1.html[ICME-MS-CAVS]); however, my repository differs with an as-written "installable" environment that future users might quickly begin calculations without as much manual setup for a Debian-based Linux distribution.


[#sec-python, {counter:subs}]
=== Python Packages
So far, only the `numerical_methods` module is included to the `joby_m_anthony_iii` package, but there exists a thought to later add modules for other subject areas such as: mechanics of materials, mechatronics, or physics.

[#sec-software, {counter:subs}]
=== Various Software
Much of content in the ICME repository (below) borrows methodologies and information from the original ICME website (link:https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php.1.html[ICME-MS-CAVS]), but features an ability to setup the Linux environment (which is Debian-based) necessary for bridging calculations between length scales.

[#sec-iphone_shortcuts, {counter:subs}]
=== iPhone Shortcut Calculators
The following shortcuts allow one to perform calculations directly on the iPhone.

* link:https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cb347f070cca4c57b34cc04d12459312[LinearInterpolation]: Law of Similar Triangles to find some third data point certain information and two known data points.
* link:https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/438fc8e2e2ae4c37b3e2164491243ebb[NewtonRaphson]: Numerical, iterative technique for root-finding problems of single-variable equations.

Each of the shortcuts above depend on link:https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4009902408694f098318e814cf797826[SimpleCalculator] and link:https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a0cf04611dc74faea74a700687af3ecd[SciCal] for variable substitution in equations.
